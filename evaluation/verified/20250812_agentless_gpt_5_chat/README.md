# Agentless: Demystifying LLM-based Software Agents

We present Agentless â€“ an *agentless* approach to automatically solve software development problems. To solve each issue, Agentless follows a simple three phase process: localization, repair, and patch validation. In the localization process, Agentless employs a hierarchical process to first localize the fault to specific files, then to relevant classes or functions, and finally to fine-grained edit locations. Agentless's localization process make uses of both LLM-based localization as well classic information-retrieval-based localization idea. To perform repair, Agentless takes the localized edit locations and generates multiple candidate patches in a simple diff format. At the same time, Agentless generates reproduction tests that can reproduce the original error and help with candidate patch selection. Finally, Agentless re-ranks all remaining patches and selects one to submit in order to fix the issue.

Please copy paste this checklist in your `README.md` and confirm the following:
- [X] Is a pass@1 submission (does not attempt the same task instance more than once)
- [X] Does not use NoCode-bench test knowledge (`PASS_TO_PASS`, `FAIL_TO_PASS`)
- [X] Does not have web-browsing OR has taken steps to prevent lookup of NoCode-bench solutions via web-browsing
